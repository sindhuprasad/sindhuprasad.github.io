`java.lang.HashMap` is a very widely used data structure in java to map keys to values. It can provide `O(1)` access and insertion time. However, HashMap maintains no particular order of the key-values inserted. Here is how it briefly works. A HashMap internally uses an array to provide `O(1)` access time. Each location in this array provides a bucket. A bucket can store multiple (key,value) pairs. To describe briefly, here is what happens when a (key,value) pair is inserted. 

1. hash code of key object is computed using `key.hashCode()`
2. The hash code value from step 1) is then mapped to one of buckets in the array.
3. Now, the key may or may not exist in the chosen bucket. 
4. If the bucket is empty, the (key,value) is simply inserted. If bucket is not empty, the key to be inserted is compared with existing keys using `equals` method. In case of a match, the new value is overwritten at the key. If there is no match with any of the keys in the bucket, its simply inserted along with the value which is same as step 3).
